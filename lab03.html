            <h2>Critique</h2>

            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>
    This critique draws on both the visualization itself and the supporting explanatory text provided beneath the infographic on the Beautiful News page.
</p>
            <p>
                The message conveyed in this visualization is rather strong and positive: "Most of the World Can Now Afford Mobile Internet.
                The design makes the point with a big donut chart and one statistic that is overwhelmingly predominant- "95 percent of the world population. It also has a lesser supporting statement regarding the threshold applied: the price of 1 gigabyte of data does not exceed.
                2% of average monthly income. The graphic is efficient, as it is easy to understand, read, and remember, on a glance. However,
                with respect to the degree of thoroughness and completeness of the evidence, according to the conception of Edward Tufte of information resolution (as complete and detailed as possible), this is a fairly.
                poor quality visualization of a complicated subject. It squeezes cost-effectiveness into one international headline figure without.
                presenting the affordability distribution, the difference between countries, or the assumptions informing the result.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of them is that viewer does not know which countries constitute the 95 percent, which countries are not considered, and how.
                there are not far away many nations, close to the cutoff. When a country is close to the threshold, then that is significantly different than a.
                country where data is much cheaper than 2% of income, and the chart is treating them equally. There is also no sense of
                uncertainty: there is none of a range, a time trend or a sign of whether the number is increasing or not, whether it is stable or sensitive to different.
                data plan choices. The visualization is conclusive, yet its measurement is probably conditional on decisions concerning.
                which plans qualify as mobile internet, the sources of pricing, and measures of income.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other critical issue of the resolution is that the definition of affordability is very low: 1GB per month and less than 2 percent of an average.
                monthly income. It will be a handy point of reference, but the visualization suggests more extensive digital access than the indicator may.
                guarantee. The icons around it (banking, health services, education, public services) indicate that affordability opens up.
                critical necessities, but most actual applications and use cases will include video-based learning, telehealth sessions, massive app updates, and even.
                day-to-day social communication- may need over 1GB in a month. The figure also fails to cover the cost of devices,
                network stability, speed, dead zones, or internet proficiency. That is, the graphic is a synonym to affordable data available in a.
                country" where people can access the internet in a meaningful manner, despite the fact that affordability is not the only obstacle.
                The brief page text carries an optimistic story of progress, yet there is not sufficient visualization of the same.
                Breadth to a viewer of determining the fullness of that assertion.
            </p>

            <h3>Effects without causes</h3>
            <p>
                The visualization primarily presents an outcome (a large number of countries satisfy an affordability metric) but not what.
                produced that change. The textual support includes potential drivers like new national broadband strategies, expansion of
                The 3G/4G coverage, number portability, and millions of people getting connected, at low prices. But these reasons are not exhibited.
                as information, and the visual aid does not relate any particular policy or infrastructure changes with affordability performance.
                The viewer is presented with a conclusion ("most can afford it now") but not the explanation trail that would assist in proving or otherwise.
                understand the claim. Then there will be only a small additional side panel, e.g. a timeline of affordability change, a comparison.
                among regions, or instances of significant changes in policy--would make resolution more effective and less of the effects without causes.
                problem.
            </p>

            <h3>Overreaching</h3>
            <p>
                The headline and frame of the visualization are in danger of going beyond the data it supports.
                population" is pronounced as almost an omnipresent right and the text putting internet as a contemporary human right is morally gratuitous.
                weight which promotes consent. Nevertheless, the measure behind it is smaller: many countries are measuring up to a.
                there is a specific affordability level of a small amount of data, not that people in those nations can receive trustworthy.
                internet in practice. Inequality can be concealed in the average income; a scheme might be affordable in the eyes of the national averages but not still.
                out of the reach of low-income households. Also, there is no visualization of whether affordability.
                is indicative of competitive markets, temporary prices, restricted coverage or variation between urban and rural coverage.
                It is a big conclusion the world can now the message is so confident and the visual is so clean.
                can receive necessary services via mobile internet) more than evidences provided on the graphic can be justified.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, this visualization succeeds as a shareable, high-impact summary of a positive trend: mobile internet is more
                affordable in many parts of the world than it used to be. Its weakness, in Tufte’s terms, is low information resolution.
                It offers a single headline statistic without the country-level detail, time context, assumptions, and limitations needed to
                evaluate the claim carefully. To strengthen integrity while keeping clarity, the graphic could add a small list of countries
                not meeting the threshold, a regional breakdown, a time trend showing change, and a brief note distinguishing
                affordability from broader access (coverage, reliability, device cost, and meaningful data needs).
