            <h2>Critique</h2>

            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>
    This critique draws on both the visualization itself and the supporting explanatory text provided beneath the infographic on the Beautiful News page.
</p>
            <p>
                The message conveyed in this visualization is strong and positive: "Most of the World Can Now Afford Mobile Internet.
                The design makes the point with a big donut chart and one statistic that is overwhelmingly predominant, "95 percent of the world population. It also has a lesser supporting statement regarding the threshold applied: the price of 1 gigabyte of data does not exceed.
                2% of average monthly income. The graphic is efficient, as it is easy to understand, read, and remember, on a glance. However,
                with respect to the degree of thoroughness and completeness of the evidence, according to the conception of Edward Tufte of information resolution (as complete and detailed as possible), this is a fairly.
                poor quality visualization of a complicated subject. It squeezes cost-effectiveness into one international headline figure without.
                presenting the affordability distribution, the difference between countries, or the assumptions informing the result.
            </p>
            <p>
                One issue is that the viewer does not know which countries make up the 95 percent, which countries are excluded, or how close many nations are to the affordability cutoff. A country that barely meets the threshold is meaningfully different from a country 
                where mobile data costs far less than 2% of income, yet the visualization treats them as equivalent. There is also no sense of uncertainty: the graphic provides no range, time trend, or indication of whether affordability is increasing, stable, or sensitive to different 
                data plan choices. The visualization appears conclusive, even though the measurement likely depends on decisions about which plans qualify as mobile internet, which pricing sources are used, and how income is measured.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other critical issue of the resolution is that the definition of affordability is very low: 1GB per month and less than 2 percent of an average monthly income. It serves as a handy point of reference, but the visualization suggests more extensive 
                digital access than the indicator may guarantee. The icons around the chart (banking, health services, education, and public services) imply that affordability opens up critical necessities. However, most actual applications and use cases—such as video-based learning, 
                telehealth sessions, large app updates, and day-to-day social communication—often require more than 1GB per month. The figure also fails to account for the cost of devices, network stability, speed, coverage gaps, or internet proficiency. In effect, the graphic equates 
                affordable data availability within a country with meaningful internet access, despite the fact that affordability is not the only obstacle. While the brief page text presents an optimistic narrative of progress, the visualization does not provide sufficient breadth for 
                viewers to fully assess the strength of that claim.
            </p>

            <h3>Effects without causes</h3>
            <p>
                The visualization primarily presents an outcome—a large number of countries meeting an affordability metric—without explaining what produced that change. 
                The supporting text mentions potential drivers such as new national broadband strategies, expansion of 3G and 4G coverage, number portability, and millions 
                of people getting connected at lower prices. However, these factors are not visualized as data, nor does the graphic link any specific policies or infrastructure 
                developments to affordability outcomes. The viewer is presented with a conclusion (“most can afford it now”) without the explanatory pathway needed to understand or evaluate the claim. A small additional element, such as a timeline of affordability changes, regional comparisons, 
                or examples of major policy shifts, would improve information resolution and reduce the “effects without causes” problem.
            </p>

            <h3>Overreaching</h3>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, this visualization succeeds as a shareable, high-impact summary of a positive trend: mobile internet is more
                affordable in many parts of the world than it used to be. Its weakness, in Tufte’s terms, is low information resolution.
                It offers a single headline statistic without the country-level detail, time context, assumptions, and limitations needed to
                evaluate the claim carefully. To strengthen integrity while keeping clarity, the graphic could add a small list of countries
                not meeting the threshold, a regional breakdown, a time trend showing change, and a brief note distinguishing
                affordability from broader access (coverage, reliability, device cost, and meaningful data needs).
