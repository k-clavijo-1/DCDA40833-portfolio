  Welcome to my DCDA 40833 Skills Portfolio. This website showcases the work I complete throughout the semester as I develop foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and digital communication.

<p>
  Hi! I’m Katherine Clavijo, a senior at Texas Christian University majoring in Strategic Communication with a minor in Business and Data Culture and Data Analytics. I’m originally from Ecuador, and one interesting fact about me is that I enjoy analyzing how trends spread on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.
</p>

<p>
  My interests include digital culture, consumer behavior, and using data to tell meaningful stories. I enjoy content creation, exploring analytics tools, and understanding how audiences interact with digital media.
</p>
<!-- I wrote this paragraph to highlight the technical skills I hope to gain,
     especially HTML, CSS, and structuring web content -->
<p>
  In this course, I hope to strengthen my skills in HTML and CSS, learn how to structure and style web pages, and gain confidence building projects that are both functional and visually clear. I also want to improve how I present information and document my learning throughout the semester.
</p>
