            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In this lab, I evaluated two AI tools—ChatGPT and Leonardo AI—using a structured
                framework focused on capabilities, appropriate use, ethics, and transparency.
                The purpose of this analysis was to critically assess how AI tools can support
                academic and professional work while still requiring human judgment,
                verification, and responsible disclosure.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT was found to be highly effective in text generation, summarization, and
                structural support across a variety of tasks. When asked to explain complex
                concepts related to digital ethics and data analysis, the tool produced
                well-structured responses that were clear and easy to understand. It was also
                useful in generating the initial HTML skeleton for a portfolio page, which
                saved time during early development. However, ChatGPT showed weaknesses when
                asked for specific sources or current factual information. Some responses
                sounded confident but required external verification, highlighting the tool’s
                tendency to favor fluency over accuracy. Output quality varied significantly
                depending on prompt clarity.
            </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT is most appropriate for early-stage ideation, outline creation,
                summarizing readings, and assisting with code structure. It functions best as a
                support tool that improves efficiency rather than replacing original thinking.
                Poor use cases include relying on the tool for final analytical conclusions,
                factual authority, or unattributed academic work.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT is trained on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human
                trainers, and publicly available information. This raises concerns related to
                bias, authorship, and originality. While safeguards exist to reduce harmful
                content, accuracy is not guaranteed. Ethical use requires transparency,
                verification, and disclosure when AI assistance is involved.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 2: Leonardo AI</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
                Leonardo AI proved effective in generating visually compelling images for
                creative and marketing-related purposes. When prompted to produce Gen Z–
                focused advertising visuals and conceptual illustrations, the tool generated
                polished images suitable for mood boards and early creative brainstorming.
                However, it struggled with fine details such as readable text and realistic
                human features. Repeated prompts sometimes produced visually similar results,
                suggesting limits in originality without extensive refinement.
            </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                Leonardo AI is most effective for visual ideation, concept development, and
                creative inspiration. It is best used during the brainstorming phase of a
                project rather than for final branded assets or client-ready designs. Human
                designers and strategic judgment are still required to refine and contextualize
                AI-generated visuals.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                Ethical concerns include intellectual property, originality, and
                representation. Because Leonardo AI is trained on large image datasets, there
                is a risk of style imitation and unclear ownership of outputs. Biases in
                representation may also appear. Responsibility ultimately lies with the user
                to ensure ethical, transparent, and culturally sensitive use.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                I view AI tools as supportive collaborators rather than replacements for human
                work. I would use ChatGPT for brainstorming, outlining, and efficiency, and
                Leonardo AI for visual inspiration during early creative exploration. Human
                judgment, revision, and disclosure remain essential to maintain integrity and
                originality.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the DCDA context, AI tools can increase efficiency and experimentation, but
                overreliance may weaken critical thinking and analytical depth. Skills that
                remain uniquely human include ethical judgment, cultural interpretation,
                strategic decision-making, and contextualizing data and visuals within real-
                world settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                As AI tools evolve, important evaluation questions include how the tool was
                trained, what biases or limitations exist, whether outputs can be verified,
                and what ethical responsibilities users hold.
